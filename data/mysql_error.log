eThis could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

rTo report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

tioWe will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

rIt is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
eHope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

 Thread pointer: 0x0
iAttempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
